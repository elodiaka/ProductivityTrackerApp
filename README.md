# ProductivityTrackerApp
First android app

This is a project app for a uni course asignment.
Goal: app to track your productivity by frequently asking the user "are you still working?".
Somehow this should be connected to a database so you can compare your worktime and efficiency with other students.
Possibly adding the function to disable certain apps to make sure the user stays distraction free for a preset interval.
